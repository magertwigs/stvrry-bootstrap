<h1>Web Development Programme</h1>
    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).[1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.</p>

<h1>Bootstrap</h1>
    <p>Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS and JS library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web applications). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking.</p>

        <p>HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>

        <h1>CSS</h1> <br>
        <img src="assets/css%20icon.png" alt="">
        <p>CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheet and it was created by HÃƒÂ¥kon Wium Lie in 1996 for the web developers to change the layout, colors, and fonts of their websites.

CSS is a style sheet or presentational language that is used to layout, format, and style documents that are written in HTML to make them look beautiful. CSS is generally used with HTML to change the style of web pages and user interfaces. You can use CSS to change the color, backgrounds, borders, paddings, margins, fonts, icons, position and various other properties of HTML elements in a web document.</p>
